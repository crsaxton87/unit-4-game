# jQuery RPG Game

### Overview

This is a simple RPG game demonstrating the ability to dynamically update HTML pages using Javascript and jQuery.

### How to Play

1. Begin by choosing a character to play as. Your character will move to the left side of the stage with its health in the corresponding bubble.

2. Next, choose which enemy you would like to fight first. That enemy will move to the right side of the stage with its health in the corresponding bubble.

3. Click the attack button to attack. The hero's attack will increase by its base value each time you attack.

4. The enemy will counterattack immediately after you attack using its base counterattack value, but it does not incrementally increase as the player's attack does.

5. Choose the order of your enemies wisely! Only the correct combinations will lead to victory.
